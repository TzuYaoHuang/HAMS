HAMS (Hydrodynamic Analysis of Marine Structures) is an open-source software to analyse wave-structure interactions in the frequency domain. It is based on boundary integral equation method using the potential flow theory. It is currently written in FORTRAN 90. The code has been developed by the author Yingyi Liu for nearly a decade. 

HAMS is released in the hope that it will contribute to eliminating the inequality (for those who are not able to afford to purchase a costly commercial BEM software) in the continuous research developments related to offshore engineering and ocean renewable energies.

HAMS is freely distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0, and may be modified and extended by researchers who intend to enhance its capabilities and port the code to other platforms. 

The success of HAMS should to a large extent be attributed to Prof. Bin Teng (Dalian University of Technology), who has tutored me the theory of potential flow in marine hydrodynamics and the programming skills using the [Boundary Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_element_method). The code structure and the coding style of HAMS are exactly two of the examples that I have learned and inherited from Prof. Bin Teng.

### - Please refer to the following papers for the theory:

The theory of panel method that has been used by HAMS is written in detail in the following two papers:

* Yingyi Liu (2021). Introduction of the Open-Source Boundary Element Method Solver HAMS to the Ocean Renewable Energy Community. In: Proc. of the 14th European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference, Plymouth, UK, Sep. 5–9, 2021.

* Yingyi Liu, Changhong Hu, Makoto Sueyoshi, Hidetsugu Iwashita, Masashi Kashiwagi (2016). "Motion response prediction by hybrid panel-stick models for a semi-submersible with bracings." _Journal of Marine Science and Technology_, 21:742–757.

The deepwater Green function is using a fortran subroutine (https://github.com/Hui-Liang/Green-function-in-deep-water) developed by Dr. Hui Liang. For the detailed theory you may refer to the following three papers:

* Hui Liang, Huiyu Wu, and Francis Noblesse (2018). "Validation of a global approximation for wave diffraction-radiation in deep water." _Applied Ocean Research_, 74 : 80-86.

* Huiyu Wu, Hui Liang, and Francis Noblesse (2018). "Wave component in the Green function for diffraction radiation of regular water waves." _Applied Ocean Research_, 81: 72-75.

* Huiyu Wu, Chenliang Zhang, Yi Zhu, Wei Li, Decheng Wan, Francis Noblesse (2017). "A global approximation to the Green function for diffraction radiation of water waves." _European Journal of Mechanics-B/Fluids_, 65: 54-64.

The finite-depth Green function is using a fortran subroutine FinGreen3D (https://github.com/YingyiLiu/FinGreen3D) developed by Dr. Yingyi Liu. For the detailed theory you may refer to the following two papers:

* Yingyi Liu, Shigeo Yoshida, Changhong Hu, Makoto Sueyoshi, Liang Sun, Junliang Gao, Peiwen Cong, Guanghua He (2018). "A reliable open-source package for performance evaluation of floating renewable energy systems in coastal and offshore regions." _Energy Conversion and Management_, 174: 516-536.

* Yingyi Liu, Hidetsugu Iwashita, Changhong Hu (2015). "A calculation method for finite depth free-surface green function." _International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering_, 7(2): 375-389.

Please cite appropriately the above papers in your relevant publications, reports, etc., if the HAMS code or its executable program has contributed to your work.
